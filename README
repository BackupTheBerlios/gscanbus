What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gscanbus is a little bus scanning, testing and topology visualizing tool for
the Linux IEEE1394 subsystem, with some AV/C support, especially for
controlling Camcorders and VCRs. It is intended as a debugging tool in
IEEE1394 development, but can also be used to simply check your IEEE1394 setup
on Linux.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Obviously a working IEEE1394 subsystem.
  The version included with Linux kernel 2.4.4 and up works fine (I use 2.4.6
  currently). Other versions might work as well, but this is untested. If you
  experience problems you are always encouraged to try out the latest version
  of the Linux 1394 subsystem before reporting bugs to me.

* libraw1394 0.9 or at least a CVS version of libraw1394 from late January
  2001 or newer.

* GTK+ 1.2.0 or newer.

* And of course gcc, make, etc. to compile.

How to compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

./configure
make
make install (optionally)

The installation process will install the two data files "guid-resolv.conf"
and "oui-resolv.conf" into /etc. This directory is not configurable at the
moment, but you can also run gscanbus from within the build directory without
installation, because those two files are first looked for in the current
directory.

This is my first shot at autoconf/automake, so be gentle with me. If the
build process fails, please send me a bug report, or even better send me some
nice examples of how to do it the right way. ;-)

Usage
~~~~~

./gscanbus
(or just gscanbus when you did make install)

Try clicking on some nodes to get additional information.

Click on a DVCR or DV-Camcorder to get the control buttons.

Do some transactions via the menu bar.

To get some useful debugging output on the console use the option
-v <debugging level>. "./gscanbus -v3" will give you the most verbose
debugging info.

That's all.

Bugs
~~~~

gscanbus sometimes crashes when doing a bus reset. Sorry, but I will
investigate this issue when I get the time.

Troubelshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If gscanbus aborts with the error message
" error in loading shared libraries: libraw1394.so.2: can't open shared
  object file: No such file or directory "
try one of the following:

1. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
   (or wherever you installed libraw1394)

2. add the line /usr/local/lib to the file /etc/ld.so.conf and run 
   "/sbin/ldconfig -v"

The first solution works only in the current shell, while the second solutions
solves the problem system wide once and for all. Do not forget to run ldconfig
whenever you install new libraries (it's best to run it automatically at
boot-time).

If you still have problems feel free to contact me via email. I mean it!

A word about guid-resolv.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file guid-resolv.conf is a quick-hack to give your devices
sane names in the main window of gscanbus. However the GUID of a device is
Globally Unique (as the name "Global Unique ID" suggests). So feel free to
stick your GUIDs into you config file, but don't mail them to me. It would be
of no use to stick them in the example guid-resolv.conf that is shipped with
gscanbus.

Updates
~~~~~~~

The newest version of gscanbus (as well as older versions) should always be
